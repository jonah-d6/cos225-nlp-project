## Overall Feedback for Deliverable #2

The project __seems__ to be in a good state as of commit #f78720b. There is no major feedback at this point. The only minor comment would be to modify the `pom.xml` file, specifically the `groupId` and the `artifactId` fields. Also, there are no JavaDocs for any method. I would strongly recommend to add those for the current and additional methods you implement until the next deliverable. Lastly, think about additional features that you want to add in the project. These features should be indicated by the menu options provided by the next deliverable.
